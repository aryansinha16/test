  {
    "question": "Explain the concept of convexity in the context of ALM and interest rate risk management.",
    "answer": "Convexity measures the curvature in the relationship between bond prices and interest rates, indicating how the duration of a bond changes as interest rates change. In ALM, convexity helps assess the sensitivity of a bond's price to interest rate movements. Higher convexity implies greater price sensitivity to interest rate changes. Managing convexity is essential for accurately measuring and mitigating interest rate risk."
  },
  {
    "question": "Discuss the impact of credit risk on ALM strategies and how it is managed.",
    "answer": "Credit risk, the risk of borrower default, impacts ALM strategies by influencing the quality and performance of the institution's assets. It is managed through credit analysis, diversification, setting credit limits, and monitoring credit exposures. Institutions use credit derivatives, such as credit default swaps, to hedge credit risk.
